# Voice Output (Text-to-Speech) Mode

## Overview
Voice Output mode enables the AI interviewer to speak follow-up questions aloud using the Web Speech Synthesis API. Creates a turn-based interview loop where the system responds contextually after each user answer.

## Features
- **Auto-spoken follow-ups**: Reads contextual prompts from `voiceFollowups.js` after each step
- **Visual subtitle**: Shows currently spoken text with keyboard shortcuts
- **Keyboard controls**: Shift+Space to pause, Shift+Enter to resume
- **Voice selection**: Prefers English female voices (Samantha, Victoria, or first available)
- **Speech rate**: 1.05x for natural pacing
- **Analytics tracking**: Tracks enable, spoken chars, pause/resume events

## Browser Support
| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Chrome Desktop | ✅ Full | Best voice quality |
| Chrome Mobile | ✅ Full | System voices |
| Safari Desktop | ✅ Full | High-quality voices |
| Safari Mobile | ✅ Full | Siri voices |
| Edge Desktop | ✅ Full | Chromium-based |
| Firefox Desktop | ✅ Full | Limited voices |

## Architecture

### Core Library
**src/lib/voiceTTS.js**
```javascript
speak(text, voice, rate)     // Speak text with optional voice/rate
cancelSpeech()               // Stop current speech
pauseSpeech()                // Pause (Shift+Space)
resumeSpeech()               // Resume (Shift+Enter)
isSpeaking()                 // Check if currently speaking
hasTTSSupport()              // Detect browser support
```

### Integration Points
**src/pages/CaseSimulator.jsx**
- Voice Output toggle in header (next to Voice Input)
- `speakFollowups()` function triggered on step change
- Subtitle display with keyboard shortcuts
- Auto-cleanup on unmount

### Turn-Based Flow
```
User completes Step 1 (Hypothesis)
  ↓
Click "Next" → activeStep = 2
  ↓
useEffect detects step change
  ↓
speakFollowups() called
  ↓
Reads 2 follow-up questions sequentially
  ↓
User listens → answers via voice/text
  ↓
Cycle repeats for Steps 2-4
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_ENABLE_TTS=1  # Default on, set to 0 to disable
```

### Voice Selection Logic
1. Search for English female voice (name contains "Female", "Samantha", "Victoria")
2. Fallback to first English voice
3. Fallback to system default

### Timing
- Base delay: `text.length * 50ms` (50ms per character)
- Additional pause: 1000ms between follow-ups
- Example: 60-char question = 3000ms + 1000ms = 4s total

## Analytics Events
```javascript
track('tts_enabled', { caseId })
track('tts_spoken', { chars })
track('tts_paused')
track('tts_resumed')
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Shift+Space**: Pause speech
- **Shift+Enter**: Resume speech
- Works globally when TTS mode enabled

### Visual Indicators
- Volume2 icon (animated pulse) when speaking
- VolumeX icon when TTS off
- Blue subtitle card with current text
- Keyboard shortcut hints below subtitle

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- Subtitle text is live region (implicit)
- Toggle labels are semantic
- Icons have aria context via parent labels

## Usage Flow

### 1. Enable Voice Output
```
User navigates to /#/case
Clicks "Voice Output" toggle
track('tts_enabled') fires
```

### 2. Step Progression
```
User on Step 1 (Hypothesis)
Completes answer → clicks "Next"
activeStep changes to 2
useEffect triggers speakFollowups()
```

### 3. Speech Playback
```
Subtitle appears: "Name the top 3 drivers..."
speechSynthesis.speak() called
track('tts_spoken', { chars: 45 }) fires
User hears question aloud
```

### 4. Pause/Resume
```
User presses Shift+Space
pauseSpeech() called
track('tts_paused') fires
Speech pauses mid-sentence

User presses Shift+Enter
resumeSpeech() called
track('tts_resumed') fires
Speech continues
```

### 5. Step Completion
```
Follow-ups finish speaking
Subtitle disappears
User answers via voice/text
Cycle repeats on next step
```

## Error Handling

### No TTS Support
```javascript
if (!hasTTSSupport()) {
  // Toggle not rendered
  // No errors thrown
}
```

### Speech Synthesis Error
```javascript
utterance.onerror = (e) => {
  console.error('TTS error:', e);
  // Continues without blocking UI
}
```

### Cleanup on Unmount
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => cancelSpeech();
}, [activeStep, ttsMode]);
```

## Integration with Voice Input

### Independent Toggles
- Voice Input: User speaks answers
- Voice Output: Interviewer speaks questions
- Can enable both, one, or neither

### Combined Flow
```
1. User enables both toggles
2. Interviewer speaks: "What's your hypothesis?"
3. User clicks "Push to talk" → speaks answer
4. Transcript populates field
5. User clicks "Next"
6. Interviewer speaks next follow-ups
7. Loop continues through all 5 steps
```

## Performance

### Bundle Impact
- JS bundle: 420.64 kB (132.96 kB gzipped) - +3 kB
- CSS bundle: 68.16 kB (11.72 kB gzipped) - +0.12 kB
- No new dependencies (uses native Web Speech API)

### Memory Usage
- Single utterance object in memory
- Auto-cleanup on step change
- No audio file downloads

### Network Impact
- Zero network requests (client-side only)
- No API calls for TTS
- Voices are system-provided

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No voices available
**Solution**: Wait for `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` to populate
```javascript
window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = () => {
  const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
  console.log('Voices loaded:', voices.length);
};
```

### Issue: Speech cuts off mid-sentence
**Solution**: Increase timeout between follow-ups
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, text.length * 60 + 1500));
```

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts not working
**Solution**: Check for event listener conflicts
```javascript
// Ensure no other handlers preventDefault on Shift+Space
```

### Issue: Speech continues after toggle off
**Solution**: Verify cancelSpeech() in handleTtsToggle
```javascript
if (!checked) {
  cancelSpeech();
  setCurrentSpokenText('');
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Flow
```
Follow-up text → speechSynthesis.speak() → System TTS → Audio output
                        ↑
                 (No network requests)
```

### Privacy Guarantees
- No audio data sent to servers
- No text sent to third-party APIs
- All processing happens in browser
- No persistent storage of speech data

### Permissions
- No microphone access required (output only)
- No special browser permissions needed
- Works in all contexts (http/https)
