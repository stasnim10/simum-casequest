## Milo Hint Templates

This document tracks the hint categories and example coaching lines used by `hintService`.

### profitability
- Break profit into Revenue – Costs. List revenue drivers and major cost buckets before diving deeper.
- For revenue, separate Price × Volume and note any recent trend shifts or seasonality effects.
- Split costs into fixed versus variable; focus on the line items that move most with volume.
- Prioritize the biggest impact levers first (large price moves, major cost categories, volume swings).

### framework_selection
- Pick a framework that mirrors the client goal (growth, profitability, market entry, etc.).
- Start broad, then plan your deep dives: think Situation → Drivers → Synthesis.
- State a quick hypothesis, then structure supporting buckets to prove or disprove it.
- Balance completeness with focus—three crisp buckets often beat five unfocused ones.

### data_interpretation
- Double-check units and time ranges—misaligned units are a classic error.
- Look for outliers and validate whether they are real signals or data noise.
- Compare percentage changes when absolute values differ a lot in scale.
- If a number feels odd, sanity-check it against a known benchmark or prior period.

### recommendation_structuring
- Open with a headline recommendation, then share 2–3 supporting points with impact and effort.
- Quantify impact where possible (revenue lift, cost savings, timeline).
- State top assumptions and risks so leadership knows where to probe.
- Clarify quick wins versus longer initiatives, and assign owners or next steps.

_TODO: extend categories as we add more case types or upgrade to model-driven hints._
