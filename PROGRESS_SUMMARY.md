# CaseQuest Redesign & Market Sizing Module Progress

This summary captures the major changes implemented during the latest working session so you can pick up in a fresh environment with full context.

## 1. Beginner-Friendly UX Overhaul (Phase 1)
- **Onboarding Flow**
  - Added a multi-step onboarding journey with goal & learning-style selection (`src/pages/Onboarding.jsx`).
  - On first login, Milo guides new users through the dashboard via a spotlight tutorial.
  - State persists in `useStore` (`onboarding` slice) so returning users skip onboarding unless they replay it from the Help button.

- **Dashboard Redesign**
  - Simplified to a single primary CTA (“Start your first lesson” / “Continue learning”).
  - Added Milo coaching card, quick actions row, progress bar, streak, and tutorial overlay (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`).
  - Floating Help beacon (`src/components/HelpBeacon.jsx`) offers quick answers + tutorial replay.

- **Navigation & Layout**
  - Bottom navigation reduced to Home, Learn, Progress (`src/components/BottomNav.jsx`).
  - Layout now includes the Help beacon and removes legacy header KPIs (`src/components/Layout.jsx`).

- **Learning Path**
  - Linear Duolingo-style progression with locks/unlocks, “You are here” indicator, and single action button (`src/pages/LearningPath.jsx`).

## 2. Market Sizing Micro-Lesson Integration (Phase 2)
- **Seed Data**
  - Market sizing lessons (`ms1`, `ms2`, `ms3`) now store `microLesson` arrays instead of old `quiz` format (`src/data/seed.js`).
  - Each micro-lesson screen includes Milo messaging, hints, practice config, and recap questions.

- **Lesson Player**
  - `LessonPlayer.jsx` detects `lesson.microLesson` and renders the new `MicroLesson` component; legacy lessons still use the original quiz view.
  - `/lesson/ms1` is the canonical entry point for the Market Sizing module; dashboard “Quick practice” button links there.

- **MicroLesson Engine** (`src/components/MicroLesson.jsx`)
  - Handles one-concept-per-screen flow, practice inputs (voice or text), hints, feedback banners, Milo quotes, recap quiz, and lesson completion (grants XP).
  - Voice capture uses Web Speech API if available (press-and-hold mic button).

## 3. Housekeeping / Routing
- Removed the old `MarketSizing.jsx` page and redirected `/market-sizing` → `/lesson/ms1`.
- Cleared prerequisites on module `m3` (Market Sizing) so lessons unlock immediately for demo/testing.

## 4. Files Most Touched
- `src/data/seed.js`
- `src/pages/Onboarding.jsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/pages/LearningPath.jsx`
- `src/pages/LessonPlayer.jsx`
- `src/components/MicroLesson.jsx`
- `src/components/HelpBeacon.jsx`
- `src/components/Layout.jsx`
- `src/components/BottomNav.jsx`
- `src/state/store.js`

## 5. To Test the Micro-Lesson Flow Quickly
1. Stop Vite, delete cache (`rm -rf node_modules/.vite`), restart with `npm run dev -- --force`.
2. In the browser devtools → Application → Storage, remove `casequest-storage`.
3. Visit one of:
   - `#/lesson/ms1` (Market Sizing Foundations)
   - `#/lesson/ms2` (Top-Down Playbook)
   - `#/lesson/ms3` (Hybrid & Mastery)
4. You should see Milo’s micro-lesson UI (no “Start Quiz” card).

## 6. Outstanding Next Steps
- Hook the new analytics events (`micro_practice_*`, `micro_lesson_*`) into dashboards/reports.
- Port the micro-lesson structure to other modules.
- Continue Phase 2 polish: additional visuals, error/empty states, Milo hints, etc.
