## ✅ Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Critical Security Fix
**Issue:** Firebase API keys exposed in source code  
**Action:** 
- ✅ Moved all Firebase credentials to `.env` file
- ✅ Updated `firebase.js` to use `process.env` variables
- ✅ Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.env.example` template already exists

**Impact:** API keys no longer exposed in repository

### 2. Comprehensive Planning
**Action:**
- ✅ Created `IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md` - 10-phase improvement plan
- ✅ Created `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Immediate action items with code examples
- ✅ Prioritized improvements by impact and urgency

**Impact:** Clear path forward for development

## 🛠️ Technical Debt Acknowledged

### High Priority
1. **App.js refactor** - 750+ lines, needs modularization
2. **Routing** - Manual state switching limits functionality
3. **Testing** - No unit/integration tests currently
4. **AI backend** - Currently stubbed, needs real implementation

### Medium Priority
1. **State management** - Prop drilling in some components
2. **Content storage** - Sample data in code vs Firestore
3. **Security rules** - Firebase rules need hardening
4. **Performance** - Code splitting and lazy loading needed

### Low Priority
1. **TypeScript** - Would improve type safety
2. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. **Internationalization** - Multi-language support
4. **Mobile apps** - React Native versions
