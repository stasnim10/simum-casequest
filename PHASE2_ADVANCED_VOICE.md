## Technical Details

### Voice Loading
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadVoices = () => setVoices(getVoices().filter(v => v.lang.startsWith('en')));
  loadVoices();
  speechSynthesis.addEventListener('voiceschanged', loadVoices);
  return () => speechSynthesis.removeEventListener('voiceschanged', loadVoices);
}, []);
```

Voices load asynchronously in browsers. The `voiceschanged` event ensures voices are loaded when available.

### Preference Persistence
```javascript
// Save
localStorage.setItem('cq_voice_prefs', JSON.stringify(voicePrefs));

// Load
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cq_voice_prefs') || '{"rate":1.05,...}');
```

### Voice Selection Logic
1. If `voiceName` is set in prefs, use that voice
2. Else, find English voice with "Samantha", "Victoria", or "Female"
3. Else, use first English voice
4. Else, use browser default
