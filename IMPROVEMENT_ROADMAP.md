## üéØ Phase 1: Architecture & Foundation (Priority: High)

### 1.1 Refactor App.js (Critical)
**Problem:** App.js is 750+ lines, mixing auth, routing, state, and data  
**Solution:**
- [ ] Extract authentication logic to `src/auth/AuthProvider.js`
- [ ] Move sample data to `src/data/sampleData.js`
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useUserData.js` for user state
- [ ] Implement React Router for proper routing
- [ ] Split into smaller, focused components

**Impact:** Improved maintainability, testability, and developer experience

### 1.2 Implement React Router
**Problem:** Manual state-based routing limits functionality  
**Solution:**
- [ ] Install `react-router-dom`
- [ ] Define routes: `/`, `/learn`, `/cases`, `/ai-interview`, `/progress`, `/shop`
- [ ] Enable deep linking and browser navigation
- [ ] Add route guards for authenticated pages

**Impact:** Better UX, SEO, and navigation

### 1.3 State Management
**Problem:** Prop drilling and scattered state logic  
**Solution:**
- [ ] Implement Context API with reducers OR
- [ ] Use Zustand for lightweight global state
- [ ] Create stores: `authStore`, `userProgressStore`, `contentStore`
- [ ] Centralize state updates

**Impact:** Cleaner code, easier debugging
