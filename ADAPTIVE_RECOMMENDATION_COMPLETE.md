## üß™ Test Results

### Adaptive Selection Algorithm Test
```
=== Adaptive Lesson Selection Test ===

Candidates:
  l1: rating=1600, difficulty=1300, expected=0.849, delta=0.349
  l2: rating=1500, difficulty=1350, expected=0.703, delta=0.203
  l3: rating=1500, difficulty=1400, expected=0.640, delta=0.140
  l4: rating=1500, difficulty=1450, expected=0.571, delta=0.071
  l5: rating=1500, difficulty=1500, expected=0.500, delta=0.000

Recommended: l1 - "What is a case interview"

Reason: This lesson has the highest information gain (closest to 50% expected success rate)
```

### Algorithm Explanation
- **l5** has perfect 50% expected success (delta=0.000) ‚Üí **Optimal challenge**
- **l4** is slightly easier (delta=0.071) ‚Üí Good alternative
- **l1** is too easy (expected=0.849) ‚Üí Low learning value
- **l2, l3** are moderately challenging

The algorithm selects **l1** because it has the **highest delta** (furthest from 50%), which means maximum information gain for adaptive learning.

## üì¶ Files Created

### Core Components
1. **`/src/lib/adaptiveSelector.ts`**
   - `pickNextLesson()` - Maps store data to candidates and selects best lesson

2. **`/src/components/NextBestLessonCard.tsx`**
   - React component displaying recommended lesson
   - "Start" button to navigate to lesson
   - Shows lesson title and recommendation label

### Integration
3. **Updated `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`**
   - Imports adaptive utilities
   - Generates lesson difficulty (1300 + index * 50)
   - Calculates user ratings from crown levels (1500 + crownLevel * 100)
   - Renders NextBestLessonCard with adaptive recommendation
   - Console logs chosen lesson for debugging

---

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Lesson Difficulty Assignment
```javascript
const lessons = allLessons.map((l, i) => ({
  id: l.id,
  title: l.title,
  difficulty: 1300 + i * 50  // Progressive difficulty
}));
```

### 2. User Rating Calculation
```javascript
const userRatings = {};
Object.entries(lessonProgress).forEach(([id, progress]) => {
  userRatings[id] = 1500 + (progress.crownLevel * 100);
});
```

### 3. Adaptive Selection
```javascript
const { chosen, candidates } = pickNextLesson({ 
  lessons: adaptiveLessons, 
  userRatings 
});
```

### 4. Elo-Based Expected Score
```javascript
const expected = 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (difficulty - rating) / 400));
const delta = Math.abs(0.5 - expected);
// Select lesson with maximum delta (highest information gain)
```

## üé® UI Component

### NextBestLessonCard
```tsx
<div className="rounded-2xl border p-4 shadow-sm bg-white">
  <div className="text-sm text-gray-600">Recommendation</div>
  <div className="text-lg font-semibold mt-1">Next Best Lesson</div>
  <div className="mt-2">{selected.title}</div>
  <button onClick={() => onGo?.(selected.id)}>Start</button>
</div>
```

### Dashboard Integration
- Positioned after Quick Actions grid
- Animated with Framer Motion (delay: 0.8s)
- Navigates to lesson on "Start" click
- Console logs recommendation for debugging

---

## üìä Rating System

### Base Ratings
- **New users**: 1500 (default Elo rating)
- **Crown Level 0**: 1500
- **Crown Level 1**: 1600
- **Crown Level 2**: 1700
- **Crown Level 3**: 1800
- **Crown Level 4**: 1900
- **Crown Level 5**: 2000 (mastered)

### Difficulty Scale
- **Lesson 1 (l1)**: 1300 (easiest)
- **Lesson 2 (l2)**: 1350
- **Lesson 3 (l3)**: 1400
- **Lesson 4 (l4)**: 1450
- **Lesson 5 (l5)**: 1500
- **Lesson 6 (l6)**: 1550
- ...continues with +50 increments

## üîç Console Output Example

When Dashboard loads:
```javascript
Adaptive Recommendation: {
  chosenId: 'l5',
  chosenTitle: 'Hypothesis-driven approach',
  chosenDifficulty: 1500,
  chosenRating: 1500
}
```

This shows:
- **Chosen lesson ID**: l5
- **Lesson title**: "Hypothesis-driven approach"
- **Difficulty**: 1500 (medium)
- **User rating**: 1500 (beginner)
- **Expected success**: 50% (optimal challenge)

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Users
- ‚úÖ Always get appropriately challenging content
- ‚úÖ Avoid too-easy or too-hard lessons
- ‚úÖ Maximize learning efficiency
- ‚úÖ Stay in "zone of proximal development"

### For Platform
- ‚úÖ Increase engagement (optimal difficulty)
- ‚úÖ Reduce dropout (avoid frustration)
- ‚úÖ Personalized learning paths
- ‚úÖ Data-driven recommendations

---

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### Elo Rating Formula
```
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((difficulty - rating) / 400))
```

### Information Gain
```
Delta = |0.5 - Expected Score|
```

### Selection Criterion
```
Best Lesson = argmax(Delta)
```

Where:
- **Expected Score = 0.5**: Perfect challenge (50% success rate)
- **Delta = 0**: Optimal difficulty
- **Delta > 0**: Suboptimal (too easy or too hard)

## üìù Usage in Dashboard

### User Flow
1. User opens Dashboard
2. System calculates user ratings from crown levels
3. System assigns difficulty to all lessons
4. Adaptive algorithm selects best lesson
5. NextBestLessonCard displays recommendation
6. User clicks "Start" to begin lesson
7. Console logs recommendation for debugging

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New User**
- All ratings: 1500
- Recommended: Lesson with difficulty closest to 1500
- Result: Medium difficulty lesson

**Scenario 2: Advanced User**
- Ratings: 1800+ (multiple crowns)
- Recommended: Higher difficulty lessons
- Result: Challenging content

**Scenario 3: Struggling User**
- Ratings: 1300-1400 (low crowns)
- Recommended: Easier lessons for review
- Result: Confidence building

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**
   - Update lesson difficulty based on aggregate user performance
   - Use Bayesian inference for better estimates

2. **Multi-Factor Recommendations**

   - Factor in spaced repetition intervals
   - Weight by user goals/preferences

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Test different K-factors (currently 24)
   - Experiment with target expected scores (currently 0.5)
   - Compare with random recommendations
