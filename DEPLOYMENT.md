## 🔧 Setup for Full AI Functionality

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key

2. Create account and get API key (starts with `sk-`)
3. Add billing method (costs ~$0.01-0.05 per conversation)

### 2. Configure for Production
Since this is deployed on GitHub Pages, you have two options:

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)
1. Fork the repository
2. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Add secret: `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key
4. Redeploy using GitHub Actions

#### Option B: Direct Configuration (Quick Test)
1. Edit `src/services/aiService.js`
2. Replace `process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual key
3. Run `npm run deploy`

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit API keys to public repositories!
