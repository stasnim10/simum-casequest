## 📊 Turn-Based Interview Flow

### Complete User Journey
```
1. User navigates to /#/case
   ↓
2. Enables "Voice Input" + "Voice Output" toggles
   ↓
3. Accepts voice consent (first time)
   ↓
4. Step 0: Clarifying Questions
   - Interviewer speaks: "What clarifying questions would help narrow the scope?"
   - User clicks "Push to talk" → speaks answer
   - Transcript populates field
   ↓
5. User clicks "Next" → Step 1: Hypothesis
   - Interviewer speaks: "What's the 1-2 sentence hypothesis linking drivers to the outcome?"
   - User speaks hypothesis via VoiceBar
   - Transcript populates field
   ↓
6. User clicks "Next" → Step 2: Framework
   - Interviewer speaks: "Name the top 3 drivers that would confirm or refute this hypothesis."
   - User speaks: "I'll use a profitability framework"
   - System maps to "Profitability" structure
   ↓
7. User clicks "Next" → Step 3: Quant Analysis
   - Interviewer speaks: "Quantify revenue, cost, and margin with any assumptions you're making."
   - User speaks: "revenue is 120 million cost is 90 million margin is 30 million"
   - System parses numbers into quant fields
   ↓
8. User clicks "Next" → Step 4: Recommendation
   - Interviewer speaks: "State a crisp recommendation with impact, risk, and next step."
   - User speaks recommendation
   - Transcript populates field

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Voice Output toggle not visible
- **Solution**: Check VITE_ENABLE_TTS=1 in .env.production
- **Solution**: Verify hasTTSSupport() returns true

**Issue**: No voices available
- **Solution**: Wait for speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged event
- **Solution**: Reload page to trigger voice loading

**Issue**: Speech cuts off mid-sentence
- **Solution**: Increase delay: `text.length * 60 + 1500`
- **Solution**: Check browser voice quality settings

**Issue**: Keyboard shortcuts not working
- **Solution**: Ensure no other handlers preventDefault on Shift+Space
- **Solution**: Check focus is not in input field

**Issue**: Speech continues after toggle off
- **Solution**: Verify cancelSpeech() in handleTtsToggle
- **Solution**: Check useEffect cleanup function
